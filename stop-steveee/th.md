## Who is Steveee?
"Steveee" is a YouTube *creator* [^1] who has recently appeared and started to rapidly create short 'Minecraft meme' videos that have raised them into YouTube stardom because, well, people *like* that kind of stuff...
In fact, they have gained nearly two million subscribers in around three months, and earn an estimated £9.9K–£158.9K [^2]
## Why do we need to stop them?
The catch, however, is that while most of these videos are just mass-produced, low-quality shorts hopping on trends, a significant amount of the videos feature a [Datapack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_Pack) or [Resource Pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Pack), usually silly or joke ones.
To put it simply, Stevee does **not** make these packs, they take other people's creations and use them in their own videos without credit or appreciation for the original authors.
Ordinarily, if one's creation is featured in a YouTube video, it's a really good thing; online exposure like that brings a wider audience to one's work, but Stevee is denying that to the creators by not credititng them, the videos are usually 30–60 seconds long with lazy or nonexistent descriptions and equally uhelpful titles.
