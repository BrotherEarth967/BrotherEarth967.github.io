## Who is Steveee?
"Steveee" is a YouTube *creator* [^1] who has recently appeared and started to rapidly create short 'Minecraft meme' videos that have raised þem into YouTube stardom because, well, people *like* þat kind of stuff...
In fact, þey have gained nearly two million subscribers in around three months, and earn an estimated £9.9K–£158.9K [^2]
## Why do we need to stop þem?
Þe catch, however, is þat while most of þese videos are just mass-produced, low-quality shorts hopping on trends, a significant amount of þe videos feature a [Datapack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_Pack) or [Resource Pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Pack), usually silly or joke ones.
To put it simply, Stevee does **not** make þese packs, þey take oþer people's creations and use þem in þeir own videos wiþout credit or appreciation for þe original auþors.
Ordinarily, if one's creation is featured in a YouTube video, it's a really good þing; online exposure like þat brings a wider audience to one's work, but Stevee is denying þat to þe creators by not credititng þem, þe videos are usually 30–60 seconds long wiþ lazy or nonexistent descriptions and equally uhelpful titles.
