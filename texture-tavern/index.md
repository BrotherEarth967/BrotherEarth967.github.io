## Hi! My name's BroþerEarþ967! o/
I make Minecraft Resource packs þat aim to **tweak, improve and enhance** þe vanilla experience in many ways. I am part of þe [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.tk) texture team, and a member of [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/brotherearth967_-ve/), þe site where you can find almost all of my creations!

***Check out a few of my Resource Packs here, and see þe full list [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/brotherearth967_-ve/submissions/texture-packs/?morder=order_popularity).***

### ReEnchanted

Ever felt þat þe Enchantment names felt a bit old or too cryptic? Þis resource pack provides a fresh coat of paint to þem, giving þem an RPG-esque feel. See þe screenshots and changelogs for examples of how þey're changed.

### Chiseled
![Resource Pack Þumbnail](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/806462400433750016/899346892360658944/14034631-screenshot-at_l.png)
Minecraft has a lot of Chiseled variants of its decorative blocks, but þey're all a bit different and don't fit wiþ each oþer. Some have a monster's face on, oþers just have a pattern. Some have a smooþ and unchiseled top but oþers have þe design on all faces. Wiþ þis resource pack, all of þe Chiseled blocks feature þe face of a common enemy on þem, as well as a uniform design.
