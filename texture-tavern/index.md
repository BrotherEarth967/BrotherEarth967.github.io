## Hi! My name's BrotherEarth967! o/
I make Minecraft Resource packs that aim to **tweak, improve and enhance** the vanilla experience in many ways. I am part of the [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.tk) texture team, and a member of [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/brotherearth967_-ve/), the site where you can find almost all of my creations!

***Check out a few of my latest Resource Packs here, and see the full list [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/brotherearth967_-ve/submissions/texture-packs/?morder=order_popularity).***

## Recent Packs

### ReEnchanted

Ever felt that the Enchantment names felt a bit old or too cryptic? This resource pack provides a fresh coat of paint to them, giving them an RPG-esque feel. See the screenshots and changelogs for examples of how they're changed.

### Chiseled

Minecraft has a lot of Chiseled variants of its decorative blocks, but they're all a bit different and don't fit with each other. Some have a monster's face on, others just have a pattern. Some have a smooth and unchiseled top but others have the design on all faces. With this resource pack, all of the Chiseled blocks feature the face of a common enemy on them, as well as a uniform design.

I redrew the Cog from the Terraria Calamity Mod update trailer thumbnail, couldn't find it anywhere else so just had to eye it.
