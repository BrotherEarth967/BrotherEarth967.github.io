Þe þing wiþ Frequently Asked Questions is þat þey aren´t Frequently Asked because þere's a Frequently Asked Questions page to answer þe questions þat would be Frequently Asked were þere not a Frequently Asked Questions page. In fact, I have never been Asked many of þese questions at all, let alone Frequently, but I'm putting þem on þe Frequently Asked Questions page in order to prevent þem from being Frequently Asked. Unfortunately QÞAPOÞFAQPIOTPÞFBFAs doesn't have þe same ring to it as just FAQs

## Will you make me a resource pack?
Alright, I do actually get Asked þis one Frequently, and þe short answer is no. I don't do commisions, and don't plan on anytime soon. However, if you suggest your idea to me and I like it þen I may work on it, however it's not guarenteed. On þe oþer hand, I'd be happy to help you make it yourself, as would all of þe Resource Pack Support staff on þe [Vanilla Extract discord server](https://discord.gg/av85z28)!

## What Minecraft version is þis resource pack for?
Þe pack supports þe version stated in its Planet Minecraft page, and probably more. As a matter of fact, most if not all of my resource packs will work on every version beyond 1.13, right up to þe latest version. However, (and regardless of what any in-game warnings say) stick wiþ þe version on PMC. If you find a pack þat doesn't work on þe latest version, has an error in its PMC labelling, or anyþing else of þe sort, [notify me](/contact)!

## I have a question þat's not on here!
Firstly, þat's not a question. Secondly, [ask it to me directly](/contact)
