# Frequently Asked Questions

The thing with Frequently Asked Questions is that they aren´t Frequently Asked because there's a Frequently Asked Questions page to answer the questions that would be Frequently Asked were there not a Frequently Asked Questions page. In fact, I have never been Asked many of these questions at all, let alone Frequently, but I'm putting them on the Frequently Asked Questions page in order to prevent them from being Frequently Asked. Unfortunately QTAPOTFAQPIOTPTFBFAs doesn't have the same ring to it as just FAQs

## Will you make me a resource pack?
Alright, I do actually get Asked this one Frequently, and the short answer is no. I don't do commisions, and don't plan on anytime soon. However, if you suggest your idea to me and I like it then I may work on it, however it's not guarenteed. On the other hand, I'd be happy to help you make it yourself, as would all of the Resource Pack Support staff on the [Vanilla Extract discord server](https://discord.gg/av85z28)!

## What Minecraft version is this resource pack for?
The pack supports the version stated in its Planet Minecraft page, and probably more. As a matter of fact, most if not all of my resource packs will work on every version beyond 1.13, right up to the latest version. However, (and regardless of what any in-game warnings say) stick with the version on PMC. If you find a pack that doesn't work on the latest version, has an error in its PMC labelling, or anything else of the sort, [notify me]()!

## I have a question that's not on here!
Firstly, that's not a question. Secondly, [ask it to me directly]()
