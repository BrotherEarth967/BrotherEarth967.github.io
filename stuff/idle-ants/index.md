## What is Idle Ants?
Idle Ants is an online incremental game. You can play it on þe [creator's github site](https://scorzy.github.io/IdleAnt), or on [Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com/games/scorzy88/idle-ants), or on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.lorenzo.idleants). It also has a [sequel](https://scorzy.github.io/IdleAnt2/), wiþ redesigned UI and some rebalancing. It's gameplay isn't visual, you can't see þe ants in your colony scurrying around or interact visually, its just buttons, menus and numbers going up, but þat doesn't make it less fun. Þe game is basically:
* Ants produce food
* Þe more food you have, þe more ants you can buy
* Þe more ants you have, þe faster food gets produced.
Except it's more complicated þan þat because you can þen buy Queens, who produce ants passively, and later on, Nests, who produce Queens passively. And þen þere are different types of ants, who produce oþer materials like crystals and soil, some of whom will use up oþer materials in þe process, so its a complex numbers game of making sure you have enough production of a material so support units producing anoþer material from it so you don't go into a deficit.

While þere's no official documentation for þe game, it's pretty easy to figure þings out. And yes, þat does say Octillion and Nonillion in þe screenshot above. What can I say, it's fun‽

## Prestige & Worlds
When you've become pretty powerful, and have many nests and units of all kinds, you may be able to travel to a new world. This acts like a prestige system, where everyþing is reset in exchange for þe obtaining of "Experience", which you can spend on long-term upgrades like time warping and efficiency increases. Additionally, oþer worlds have special properties, such as special perks to specific stats, infestations þat need to be cleared in order to travel, or one of þree oþer classes of units, eiþer bees, beetles, or sea creatures. Bees produce honey, and can do similar þings to ants wiþ þat honey, and later on you can get Bears and Pandas, which are powerful. Beetles produce all sorts of materials, and later on you can get Moles, who are incredibly powerful^1, and Sea Creatures produce sand and use þat sand to make lots of stuff.

## Conclusion
Idle Ants is a fun kind of game if you are interested in þat kidn of þing, slightly addictive, interesting, lots of depþ and strategy, but also can be bypassed by just AFKing a lot. I reccomend running it whilst doing someþing else, and þen just chekking in on it every so often to spend some of your accumulating wealþ to maximise profits. Plus leave it running overnight :stonks:. 9/10 would grind again.
