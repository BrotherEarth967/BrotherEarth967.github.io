Welcome to the webgame cave, a place where I list and reccomend some brilliant games you can play online for free! We've got some clickers, incrementals (like Idle Ants), text adventures, platformers, and many more! Enjoy!

### A Dark Room

This game is one of the most incredible games I've ever seen. It looks simple at first, and the early gameplay is carefully and deliberately paced, but eventually it unfolds a bit more and really immerses you in the world. Totally worth the time you spend on it.

You can play it [here](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), read about it on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dark_Room), listen to its soundtrack [contributed to the game by Orsi](https://reddit.com/r/ADarkRoom/comments/hh17qw) [here](https://orsi.bandcamp.com/album/a-dark-and-quiet-room), be aware of spoilers on its Wiki [here](https://adarkroom.fandom.com), and here are some reddit threads with people discussing the game: [1](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1g3ud2),[2](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1qkz2w),[3](https://reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1melwz)

#### The Extra Mile
There's also a mobile version made by [Amir Rajan](http://amirrajan.net/games/) which is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourcompany.adarkroom&hl=en_US) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/a-dark-room-switch/). It's a bit different, so I'd reccommend playing the browser one first. Amir also made a prequel game called [The Ensign]

### Gridland

From the same creator as A Dark Room, a unique and charming RPG take on the "Match 3" game concept, except rather than and advert-filled mobile game, you build little pixel buildings to survive. However, when night falls, all the resources of. the board change, some to helpful equipment, others to dangerous monsters, changing the way you play completely. If you keep playing, you might just be surprised...

You can play it [here](http://gridland.doublespeakgames.com/), watch its epic trailer [here](https://youtu.be/xZhdFcoI0Rw)listen to its soundtrack [made by Vince Nitro](https://soundcloud.com/vincenitro) [here](https://youtube.com/channel/UCUdYkb4RhCP9l3hfTHRvZeQ/search?query=OST), and learn tips and tricks on some reddit threads with people discussing the game: [1](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/8f6zcd/),[2](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/2ej4rqþ),[3](https://reddit.com/r/Gridland/comments/2en21l),[4](https://reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/2eljxt)

### Spaceplan
![Spaceplan Thumbnail](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Br686sJTnmw/maxresdefault.jpg)
A unique Idle/Clicker game where you are in a malfunctioning spaceship orbiting a familiar-looking planet. Together with a helpful AI, you try to figure things out by building a power-generation empire of... potatoes? A fun game with smooth UI and funny dialogue, worth the AFKing.

#### The Extra Mile
The game was expanded into a larger game and put on Steam. If you're willing to pay, and you like clicker games like this, it could be for you! Visit the [website](http://spaceplan.click) for more info.
