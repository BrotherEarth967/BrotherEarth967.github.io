### A Dark Room

![Þumnail of A Dark Room](https://www.doublespeakgames.com/images/adr.png)

Þis game is one of þe most incredible games I've ever seen. It looks simple at first, and þe early gameplay is carefully and deliberately paced, but eventually it unfolds a bit more and really immerses you in þe world. Totally worþ þe time you spend on it.

You can play it [here](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), read about it on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dark_Room), listen to its soundtrack [contributed to þe game by Orsi](https://reddit.com/r/ADarkRoom/comments/hh17qw) [here](https://orsi.bandcamp.com/album/a-dark-and-quiet-room), be aware of spoilers on its Wiki [here](https://adarkroom.fandom.com), and here are some reddit þreads wiþ people discussing þe game: [1](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1g3ud2),[2](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1qkz2w),[3](https://reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1melwz)

#### Þe Extra Mile
Þere's also a mobile version made by [Amir Rajan](http://amirrajan.net/games/) which is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourcompany.adarkroom&hl=en_US) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/a-dark-room-switch/). It's a bit different, so I'd reccommend playing þe browser one first. Amir also made a prequel game called [The Ensign](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-ensign/id908073488)

### Gridland

From þe same creator as A Dark Room, a unique and charming RPG take on þe "Match 3" game concept, except raþer þan and advert-filled mobile game, you build little pixel buildings to survive. However, when night falls, all þe resources of. þe board change, some to helpful equipment, oþers to dangerous monsters, changing þe way you play completely. If you keep playing, you might just be surprised...

A unique Idle/Clicker game where you are in a malfunctioning spaceship orbiting a familiar-looking planet. Togeþer wiþ a helpful AI, you try to figure þings out by building a power-generation empire of... potatoes? A fun game wiþ smooþ UI and funny dialogue, worþ þe AFKing.

### Material Warrior

![Material Warrior Þumbnail](/assets/material_warrior.png)

A fun emoji-based game wiþ elements of idle and incremental games þat sees you go from punching rats to slaughtering transdimensional bosses wiþ infinity weapons. It was designed by [gamehelp16](https://gamehelp16.github.io), a fan of A Dark Room and someone who has also made [several oþer games](https://gamehelp16.github.io/post/welcome/). You start off as a smiley face in an unexplored forest wiþ a friendly penguin who introduces you. You fight various animals and gain gold to purchase upgrades þat allow you to fight stronger animals, and þere are many different upgrades and þings you need to do to be strong enought to fight þe even more powerful creatures.

Þe game has a unique charm to it, and is well worþ a playþrough, so visit it [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/material-warrior). It has a largely inactive subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/materialwarrior), and þe code is all available [here](https://github.com/gamehelp16/material-warrior). Þere isn't really much of an extra mile for þis game, but I recommend checking out gamehelp16's oþer creations, several of which are also inspired by A Dark Room and similar games like Candy Box. (By the way, the console is really easy to use in this game, for example `Player.move(x,y)` will teleport you.)

### Shark Game

![Shark Game Logo](http://cirri.al/sharks/img/sharklogo.png)

Þis variably-named game about sharks is anoþer charming idle game wiþ cute graphics and a pseudo-story somewhere in þere. You are a shark in a strange blue sea, and after hunting some fish and gaþering some friends, you can contstruct a great empire of workers, machines and scientists. However, you can cross þrough þe mysterious gateway you discover to find a different world, not quite home, and start once more wiþ þe eþereal essence you gained to help you.

It was originally designed by [Cirrial](https://cirri.al) in 3 days for [Seamergency 2014](https://twitter.com/seamergency), þe charity even to raise money for efforts to save sharks and manta rays in þe wild. Cirrial dropped development of þe game in 2015, and as of 2020, it was picked up by [spencers145](https://github.com/spencers145). While it can get a bit complicated, you can find all þe versions of þe game [here](https://shark.tobot.dev), which consist of:

* Þe original game by Cirrial v0.71 - [Game](http://cirri.al/sharks/), [Code](https://github.com/Cirrial/SharkGame)
