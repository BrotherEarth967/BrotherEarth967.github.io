### A Dark Room
![Þumnail of A Dark Room](https://www.doublespeakgames.com/images/adr.png)

Þis game is one of þe most incredible games I've ever seen. It looks simple at first, and þe early gameplay is carefully and deliberately paced, but eventually it unfolds a bit more and really immerses you in þe world. Totally worþ þe time you spend on it.

You can play it [here](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), read about it on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dark_Room), listen to its soundtrack [contributed to þe game by Orsi](https://reddit.com/r/ADarkRoom/comments/hh17qw) [here](https://orsi.bandcamp.com/album/a-dark-and-quiet-room), be aware of spoilers on its Wiki [here](https://adarkroom.fandom.com), and here are some reddit þreads wiþ people discussing þe game: [1](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1g3ud2),[2](https://reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/1qkz2w),[3](https://reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1melwz)

#### Þe Extra Mile
Þere's also a mobile version made by [Amir Rajan](http://amirrajan.net/games/) which is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourcompany.adarkroom&hl=en_US) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/a-dark-room-switch/). It's a bit different, so I'd reccommend playing þe browser one first. Amir also made a prequel game called [The Ensign]
